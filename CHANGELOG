------

2016-05-11

  * (GH-95) *Breaking change* Using the pe_bootstrap provisioner to install
    is deprecated for 2015.2.0 and newer and raises an error starting with
    2016.2.0. Agent installs should be transitioned to the pe_agent
    provisioner.

  * (GH-116) Starting with PE 2016.2.0, the new PEM installer is used to

0.14.0
------

2016-03-26

The is a backwards compatible feature release.

    actions if PE is already installed.

  * (GH-78) Provisioners running Windows installs now wait for msiexec to
    complete and write logs to puppet-enterprise-installer.log.

  * (GH-110) The pe_agent provisioner now installs Windows agents using packages
    provided by pe_repo instead of falling back to the pe_bootstrap installer.

  * (GH-112) The pe_boostrap provisioner can be configured to download
    installers directly to the vm instead of relying on the /vagrant shared
    filesystem by setting shared_installer to false. This is useful for
    compute environments such as AWS and OpenStack where VMs are not running
    directly on the Vagrant host.

  * Add support for PE 3.8.4, 2015.3.3 and 2016.1.0.

------

------

2015-12-17

This is a backwards compatible bugfix release.

  * (GH-60) Fix PE tarball downloads on windows.

  * (GH-109) Fix pe_bootstrap agent installations for 2015.3.x. Note that this
    functionality isn't technically supposed to work in 2015.x and may break
    with upcoming releases. The pe_agent provisioner is the recommended method
    for installing 2015.x agents.

0.13.5
------

2015-12-08

0.13.2
------

2015-10-31

  * (GH-104) Fixed an issue where the `pe_agent` provisioner would reject
    PE version 2015.2.0 as being "too old".

  * (GH-105) Fixed an issue where the `pe_agent` provisioner would raise
    an error during agent deletion if the master wasn't created.

0.13.1
------

2015-10-25

This is a backwards compatible bugfix release.

  * (GH-100) Fixed an issue where the `pe_build` provisioner would fail
    validation after provisioning had been executed. Some Vagrant providers
    and plugins set up action chains that run validation multiple times.

  * (GH-101) When loading facts, POSIX guests now properly search for
    Puppet installations.

  * (GH-102) Searches for Puppet installations are performed using the root
    account and environment variables.

2015-10-18

This is a backwards compatible feature release.

  * Support for PE 2015.2.2.

  * (GH-69), (GH-54) Added a new `pe_agent` provisioner which provides
    fictionless agent installation for PE 2015.2.0 and newer. This provisioner
    also supports orchestrating actions on the PE master VM, such as setting
    up `pe_repo` to serve agent packages, signing agent certificates and
    purging agent data when VMs are destroyed.

  * (GH-99) Windows agents running PE 3.7.0 and newer are now installed from
    64-bit packages if the underlying hardware supports it.

  * (GH-91) New guest capability for retrieving VM facts using `puppet facts`.
    A basic set of `architecture`, `os` and `release` facts is provided if
    Puppet is not installed. There is a new command, `puppet pe-build facts`
    for retrieving this data in JSON format, but the primary usecase is to
    inform `pe_agent` decision-making.

0.12.0
------

2015-09-24

This is a backwards compatible feature release.

  * (GH-89) Support 2015.2.x master platforms and Windows
    This release adds support for all 2015.x.2 master platforms:

      - Enterprise Linux: 6, 7
      - Ubuntu: 12.04, 14.04
      - SLES: 11, 12

    Tarball installers are no longer available for other agent platforms, so
    support for those is currently pending. Windows installation is still
    supported.


0.11.0
------

2015-09-08

This is a feature release that also removes one deprecated command.

  * (GH-66) The `pe_bootstrap` provisioner now has a `answers_extra`
    configuration option. This option can be set to a list of strings which
    will be appended to the answer file, one entry per line.

  * (GH-44) Vagrant 1.3.0 prevented any plugin from declaring a command that
    uses a `--version` flag. The `vagrant pe-build copy` command now uses a
    flag called `--release` to specify which PE version to download.

  * (GH-35) The deprecated `vagrant pe-build download` command has been
    removed. Use `vagrant pe-build copy` instead.

0.10.4

    the installer in Virtualbox specific mount points.

-----

2013-10-14

This is a backwards incompatible bugfix and feature release.

    been improved.

Thanks to Charlie Sharpsteen for his contributions to this release.

0.6.0
-----

2013-10-03

This is a backwards compatible bugfix and feature release.

### User notes:

  * The tar archive unpacker has been split into a true tar unpacker and a
    tar.gz unpacker. Archives with either '.tar' and '.tar.gz' will be
    extracted with the correct unpacker.
  * If a version of PE is requested but there's no definition for it, release
    information for the latest version of PE will be used. This means that the
    new versions of PE that aren't yet supported should work without having to
    specify an explicit answer file.
  * PE versions with trailing version information can now be used.

0.5.0
-----

2013-09-17

This is a backwards compatible bugfix and feature release.

  * (GH-33) Added detect_installer and run_install capabilities for Windows

    so errors generated during downloads won't cause Vagrant to die with a
    stacktrace.
  * cap/detect_installer exceptions now subclass Vagrant::Errors::VagrantErrors
    so that detection errors don't cause stacktraces.
  * Archive unpacking logic has been generalized to support multiple implementations
    like 'pe_build/transfer'

Thanks to Reid Vandewiele for implementing the Windows and Solaris fixes and
extracting the 'unpack' logic.

Thanks to Charlie Sharpsteen for validating the new platform support and
correcting the issues around open_uri error handling.

### User notes:

#### Enhancements

  * New pe_bootstrap configuration option: `autosign` adds the ability to
    configure the Puppet master autosign.conf

#### Bugfixes

  * The pe_bootstrap provisioner restarts the pe-httpd service if changes were
    made to the master configuration that require a restart.

### Developer notes:

  * pe_bootstrap post-install configuration has been extracted out of the
    provisioner and into the PostInstall module.
  * post-install configuration is now handled by generating a Puppet manifest
    instead of executing sed and a shell script.

### Thanks

Thanks to Tom Linkin for his work on handling post-install configuration with
Augeas and Puppet.

0.3.0
-----

2013-08-14

This is a backwards compatible feature and bugfix release.

### User notes:

#### Enhancements:

  * Puppet Enterprise 3 is now fully supported and should have answers that
    work out of the box.
  * (GH-25) The installer for a given platform will be detected based on the
    guest platform, which means that the most precise installer will be used
    instead of the `all` installer.
  * pe_build.download_root now fully supports a local directory with URIs using
    the "file" URI.
  * As part of GH-25 pe_build.suffix defaults to detect, which will auto-select
    the correct installer name

#### Fixes:

  * (GH-23) Removed double expansion of files when running `vagrant pe-build copy`
  * (GH-24) Installer files are downloaded at provision time instead of before
    VMs are constructed

#### Deprecations:

  * Shell scripts run with the `add_step` hash are deprecated and will be
    removed in the next 'major development' release (either 0.4.0, 0.5.0,
    or 1.0.0). This behavior is effectively provided by the `shell` provisioner.

### Developer notes (AKA the gory details):

  * Informational logging has been expanded and is directed to the Vagrant
    internal loggers.
  * Answers file generation has been extracted out of the pe_bootstrap
    provisioner and into an independent class to respect the single
    responsibility principle.
  * New guest capability: "detect_installer" detects the correct installer
    for the given guest platform. Initial supported platforms are Debian,
    Ubuntu, and Redhat.
  * New guest capability: "run_install" extracts the actual command generation
    and execution to install PE on a guest. Initial supported platforms are
    Linux and Solaris.
  * Installer file transfer has been fully extracted from the PEBuild::Archive
    class and pushed into pe_build/transfer classes.
  * File transfer behavior has been abstracted behind the PEBuild::Transfer
    module and the implementing class is selected based on the scheme of the
    requested URI.
  * Almost everything ever has been beaten with the refactor hammer.

### Thanks

  * Thanks to Tom Linkin as always for his awesome work and contributions to
    this plugin.
  * Thanks to Jon Mosco for reporting GH-23.
